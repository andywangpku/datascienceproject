==================

this is the code for final presentation

all the charts in the presentation are created with d3js and javascript, the slides frame is created with HTML/CCS and jQuery. 

To play with these files and recreate the website I presented, you can copy all the files and in terminal, change directorty to this one and run ( python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 & ) , which is to setup a simple http server. Then you can access the presentation in your Chrome, by entering localhost:8888, which refers to the server you just set up and the port you just assigned to it.
The presentation is set up with a width of 1440 and a height of 900 for screen size, different size may cause trouble.
